> **Time Dilation Physically Derived Through Quantum Substrate Dynamics:  
A Coherence-Based Origin for Relativistic Delay and Causal Structure**

Quantum Substrate Dynamics (QSD) is a Lorentz-invariant, coherence-based framework in which all observable physical phenomena—mass, time, gravity, and quantization—arise from causal interactions within a conserved substrate. This paper presents the first axiom-free derivation of time dilation from substrate principles alone, replacing postulated spacetime geometry with physical coherence delay.

## Highlights

- Derives time dilation using only substrate recovery constraints:
